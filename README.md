# Design Patterns in the Admission System
## 1. Factory Pattern (RoomFactory)
- To decouple objection creation: separate the instatiation of ```Room``` objects from the rest of the system.
- Logic centralization: Rooms are created consistently
- Static methods ```CreateInitialRooms``` and ```CreateRoom``` handle creation.
- It can be extended to fetch rooms from a DB/config file without modifying client code.

## 2. Singleton Pattern (AdmissionSystem)
- Only one instance manages all admission centers.
- Prevents duplicate instances (no two centerIds will be the same).
- Private Constructor and ```Lazy<T>``` initliazation.
- Can be accessed only via ```AdmissionSystem.GetInstance()```

## 3. Observer Pattern (AdmissionCenter â†” Room)
- Rooms react to seat assignment and centers do not need to know details.
- Rooms can attach/detach at runtime.
- Subject (```AdmissionCenter```) implements ```IRoomSubject``` with ```Attach```/```Detach```/```NotifyObservers```
- Observer (```Room```) implements ```IObserver``` with ```Update()```
- When state changes in one object (center) should trigger actions in others (rooms).

## 4. Strategy Pattern (ISeatAllocationStrategy)
- New strategies can be added without changing existing code.
- Interface ```ISeatAllocationStrategy``` defines ```SelectRoom()```
- Concrete strategy ```UtilizationAwareStrategy``` implements logic.
